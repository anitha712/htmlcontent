<P>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]


Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.

Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[29] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[30] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[30] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[30][31]

Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][32] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.[33] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[34] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[35]</P>

<p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as APJ Abdul Kalam was born in a Tamil Muslim family on October 15th, 1931. Who knew that a lad who was born to poverty-stricken parents would one day become a millennial aerospace scientist and step up to be the 11th President of India? Being on a constant quest to learn and gain as much knowledge as he can, his educational journey was full of challenges. Let us walk you through APJ Abdul Kalam’s education to inspire a large number of students across the world.

Early Schooling	Rameshwaram Elementary School
Secondary Schooling	Schwartz Higher Secondary School
Undergraduate	Saint Joseph’s College
Postgraduate	Madras Institute of TechnologyWhen we talk about APJ Abdul Kalam’s education, it is quite prominent that he always wanted to make a successful career in Aviation. Becoming a fighter pilot was once his dearest dream, which was not fulfilled as he couldn’t reach the final merit of IAF. After completing his higher education, Kalam joined the DRDO (Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation) as a scientist and late in the early 1960s, worked with the INCOSPAR (Indian National Committee for Space Research) under Vikram Sarabhai, a renowned space scientist. His dedication led to the development of 4 missile projects namely Prithvi, Trishul, Akash and Nag. And due to this contribution, he earned the title of the ‘Missile Man of India’. Later in 1992, Kalam was appointed as the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister and promoted to Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India in 1999. 

APJ Abdul Kalam’s education has immensely added to his valuable role in conducting the Pokhran-II, a series of 5 nuclear test explosions in 1998. His status as a national hero made India to be recognised as a full-fledged nuclear state. This is not the end, in the same year, Kalam proposed a countrywide plan called ‘Technology Vision 2020’ to develop nuclear empowerment, and improve agricultural productivity and various technological innovations, to name a few.Beyond his work on developing India’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs, let us see how exactly the former president has played a crucial role in our knowledge and growth:

“You cannot change your future, but you can change your habits, and surely your habits will change your future.”</p>
